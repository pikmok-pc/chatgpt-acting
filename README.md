1: GPT-4 surpasses ChatGPT in its advanced reasoning capabilities.
ChatGPT
Input
Andrew is free from 11 am to 3 pm, Joanne is free from noon to 2 pm and then 3:30 pm to 5 pm. Hannah is available at noon for half an hour, and then 4 pm to 6 pm. What are some options for start times for a 30 minute meeting for Andrew, Hannah, and Joanne?
Output
Here is a list of their availability:
- Andrew: 11 am to 3 pm
- Joanne: noon to 2 pm, and 3:30 pm to 5 pm
- Hannah: noon to 12:30 pm, and 4 pm to 6 pm

Based on their availability, there is a 30-minute window where all three of them are available, which is from 4 pm to 4:30 pm. So, the meeting can be scheduled at 4 pm.

2: Safety & alignment
Training with human feedback
We incorporated more human feedback, including feedback submitted by ChatGPT users, to improve GPT-4’s behavior. We also worked with over 50 experts for early feedback in domains including AI safety and security.

Continuous improvement from real-world use
We’ve applied lessons from real-world use of our previous models into GPT-4’s safety research and monitoring system. Like ChatGPT, we’ll be updating and improving GPT-4 at a regular cadence as more people use it.
GPT-4-assisted safety research
GPT-4’s advanced reasoning and instruction-following capabilities expedited our safety work. We used GPT-4 to help create training data for model fine-tuning and iterate on classifiers across training, evaluations, and monitoring.
3: Input
Explain the plot of Cinderella in a sentence where each word has to begin with the next letter
in the alphabet from A to Z, without repeating any letters.
Output
A beautiful Cinderella, dwelling eagerly, finally gains happiness; inspiring jealous kin, love
magically nurtures opulent prince; quietly rescues, slipper triumphs, uniting very
wondrously, xenial youth zealously.
